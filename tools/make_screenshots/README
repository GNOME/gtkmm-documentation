"Semi-automatic generation of screenshots for the gtkmm tutorial"

make_screenshots.py is a Python script which is an attempt at an automatic
screenshot generator. It's not fully automatic, though. It generates
screenshots by starting an example program and saving a screenshot of the
program's window as it looks just after start-up.

69 screenshots are shown in the tutorial. 45 of them will be correctly
generated in this simple way. The other 24 screenshots require some kind of
user input or a specific location of the cursor before they are saved.

Most example programs must be built before make_screenshots.py is executed.
'make check' or 'ninja examples' does that.

The screenshots are saved by gnome-screenshot.

progs-and-figs.txt is input data to make_screenshots.py.

make_screenshots.py is not called from any Makefile or meson.build file.
