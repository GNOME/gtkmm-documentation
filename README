This is the documentation for gtkmm, a C++ API for GTK.
See http://www.gtkmm.org/

gtkmm-documentation can be built with Autotools or Meson.
Building with Autotools may be phased out in the future.

Building with Meson
-------------------
Create a build directory:
  $ cd gtkmm-documentation
  $ meson [options] <build-dir>
Do not call the build-dir gtkmm-documentation/build. There is already such a
directory, used when building with Autotools.

Print a list of configuration options:
  $ cd <build-dir>
  $ meson configure

Example of changing options:
  $ cd <build-dir>
  $ meson configure --prefix=/opt/gnome -Dbuild-translations=true

Create the html files of the tutorial:
  $ cd <build-dir>
  $ ninja

Install them:
  $ ninja install
If you have chosen to build translated XML files (build-translations=true),
installation can take some time, because the translations are built
by 'ninja install'. This may change in the future.
See https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2775

Build the example programs:
  $ ninja examples
or (probably slower)
  $ ninja test

Create a PDF file:
  $ meson configure -Dbuild-pdf=true
  $ ninja
This requires that you have either the dblatex or the xmllint and docbook2pdf
commands installed.

Make a tarball:
  $ ninja dist
In addition to the files in the git repository, the tarball will contain some
built files. These files must already exist. 'ninja dist' will fail, unless you
have previously run 'ninja' and 'ninja install' with build-translations=true.

This tarball is not identical to one made with "make dist" or "make distcheck".
There is e.g. no "configure" file. If you want to use a tarball made with
"ninja dist" for building with Autotools, you have to start with ./autogen.sh.
