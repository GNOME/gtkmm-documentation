Building with meson
-------------------
This is experimental, but it's believed to work correctly.
You're encouraged to test it.

Create a build directory:
  $ cd gtkmm-documentation
  $ meson <build-dir>
Do not call the build-dir gtkmm-documentation/build. There is already such a
directory, used when building with autotools.

Create the html files of the tutorial:
  $ cd <build-dir>
  $ ninja

Install them:
  $ ninja install

Build the example programs:
  $ ninja examples
or (probably slower)
  $ ninja test

Print a list of configuration options:
  $ meson configure

Example of changing options:
  $ meson configure --prefix=/opt/gnome -Dwarnings=fatal

Create a PDF file
  $ meson -Dbuild-pdf=true
  $ ninja
This requires that you have either the dblatex or the xmllint and docbook2pdf
commands installed.

Make a tarball:
  $ ninja dist

This tarball is not identical to one made with "make dist" or "make distcheck".
There is e.g. no "configure" file. If you want to use a tarball made with
"ninja dist" for building with autotools, you have to start with ./autogen.sh.
"make dist" and "make distcheck" don't distribute the meson.build files.
